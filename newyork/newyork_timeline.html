            <p>Following the Covid-19 timelines for <a href="../london/london_timeline.html">London</a> and 
            <a href="../sydney/sydney_timeline.html">Sydney</a>, we expanded the data visualisation to New York State. 
            Created using <a href="https://d3js.org">d3.js</a>, this interactive visualisation shows New York State's daily 
            new cases and deaths over time, against the approximate level of lockdown restrictions and events detailing the changing situation.
            </p>

            <p>Hover over the line chart to see exact numbers of cases. The hollow dots represent events, such as important decisions and 
            milestones in New York State's coronavirus response. Click on them to see more.

            <p>New York's lockdown is a bit more complex and difficult to quantify into levels than London.
            The state government started off with the New York State on Pause program, a statewide lockdown.
            Restrictions then began to ease on a county by county basis, using the newly proposed four-phase reopening
            plan. Counties could move from phase 1 to phase 4, with each phase having less restrictions than the last, provided
            they met the necessary metrics for declining hospitalisations and deaths. Restrictions became even more localised following 
            the micro-clustering strategy which would place new restrictions in cluster areas that had spikes in COVID-19 cases.
            </p>

            <p>The New York COVID-19 case data was from the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University</a>. 
            There were a few pieces of anomalous data that we found, these pieces of data were replaced using the values found from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/new-york-covid-cases.html">New York Times Interactive Covid Map</a>. 
            We looked into the anomalous dates and found that they are likely due to the reasons listed below:
                <ul>
                    <li>June 30th 2020: New York City added a backlog of deaths from unspecified dates.</li>
                    <li>August 20th 2020: New York City removed four previously reported deaths after reviewing records. The state reported four new deaths in other counties.</li>
                    <li>September 19th 2020: The values we found were initially negative so we checked the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/new-york-covid-cases.html">New York Times Interactive Covid Map</a> 
                    and its respective <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">github</a> only to find another negative value.
                    We finally checked the <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Fatalities-by-Co/xymy-pny5">New York State COVID-19 Fatalities by County dataset</a>
                    which yielded a non-negative result.
                    </li>
                    <li>March 24th 2021: After a multiday disruption in reporting data, the New York City health department reported several daysâ€™ 
                    worth of data, leading to a spike in reported cases and deaths in New York State.
                    </li>
                </ul>  
            </p>

            Lockdown level is an indication only, determined by the author based on the lockdown restrictions in New York. 
            Events were collated from multiple sources, including 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_York_(state)">Wikipedia</a> and 
            <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news">New York State Governors Pressroom</a>. 
            Examples from <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/d3noob">d3noob</a> were helpful for creating the visualisation.</p>
